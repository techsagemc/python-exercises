working on projects while learning to code

This is where the journey begins. I will embark upon the road that so many others have taken and find a way to traverse the world of programming. There will be no excuses here. Once these projects and futre projects become available within this repo, anyone will be allowed to change and edit as they like, hell break it all to hell if you want. It just gives me more reason to stay on top of my game. I hope my future self can read this one day and know that it was not all for nothing. This is my letter to my future self and the world that I was here.
